      'In the context of this data product, we have created a raw data product based on ENSTO-E, which is an open-source data provider (https://transparency.entsoe.eu/). ENTSO-E is the European association for the cooperation of transmission system operators (TSOs) for electricity. The data is provided in CSV format on a monthly basis.\n\nWhat we have covered in this data product consists of three categories (“data domains”) on a high-level: Load, Generation, Transmission of power. The granuality of the data in time is every 1hr or every 15mins for some countries.\n\nIn terms of geographical granularity of data, four main different geographical concepts are used:\n\n• countries,\n\n• bidding zones BZ (areas in which there is a uniform spot price),\n\n• control areas CA (areas in which the grid is operated by a single system operator)\n\n• market balance areas MBA (areas in which there is a uniform balancing energy price).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data product is consisting of 10 data sets.\n\n',
